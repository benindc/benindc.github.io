									<h2>Biography</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Hi! My name is Ben. I'm from Herndon, VA and a recent Virginia Tech graduate with a B.S. in 
									<a href="https://frec.vt.edu/students/undergraduate/water-resources-policy-and-management.html">Water: Resources, Policy & Management.</a> 
									During my time at Virginia Tech I worked for <a href="https://www.vikesland.cee.vt.edu/people.html">Dr. Peter Vikesland</a>
									in the <a href="https://www.sun.ictas.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology</a>.
									Here I was first exposed to lab work and independent research by studying sorbing interactions between antibiotic resistant plasmids and 
									nanoparticles.
									
									After graduating with the highest honors from Virginia Tech in 2019, I moved to Charlottesville to begin my M.S. in Civil Engineering.
									At UVA I joined <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/benson-research-group">Dean Benson's</a> research group where up until the pandemic I was researching landfill liners specialized for the removal 
									of radionuclides. Since the pandemic, I have decided to take a sabbatical from my Masters degree by working at 
									<a href="https://curativeinc.com/">Curative Inc.</a>, a COVID
									testing company, as a Clinical Lab Assistant running patient qPCR samples. I plan on returning to UVA when COVID calms down a bit.

									<h4>Undergraduate Nanoscience Research</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									From the summer of 2018 up until I went to UVA in the Fall of 2019 I was fortunate enough to partake in undergraduate research with 
									Dr. Peter Vikesland and now my good friend and PhD. to be, Ethan Boeding. 
									<a href="UndergraduateResearch.pdf" download>Here</a> is a summary of our research conducted over a year.

									<h4>Bhola Cyclone Encyclopedia Entry</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									My 2nd year at Virginia Tech I took the class "Water, Hazards and Development" by Luke Juran. As a replacement to the final paper, 
									a peer and myself were offered the opportunity to write an encyclopedia entry for publication on the 
									<a href="Bhola Cyclone_Clark MacNaughton Juran.pdf" download>Bhola Cyclone.</a> 
								</p>
								<header>
									<h4>Multisorbent Barrier Paper</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									Upon my arrival to the University of Virginia, I immediately joined forces with some ongoing work on a multisorbing barrier specialized
									for radioactive waste. My collauges and I collaborated internationally on this 
									<a href="Lin-et-al-20-MSB-sorption.pdf" download>conference paper</a> that was published in March 2020. 
								</p>
								<header>
									<h4>Hydrology Final</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									For my <a href="Hydrology Final.pdf" download>final project</a> 
									in graduate level hydrology, I was interested in modeling a potential sewage break in the Rivanna River. 
									I used this opportunity to familiarize myself with the history and economics of sanitation while also learning the basics to WASP,
									a water quality simulation program. I found the program to be very limited in its interpretation of bacterial lifecycle and transport 
									in streams, creating a shortage of data I was willing to work with.
								</p>

									<h4>Water Resources Policy and Economics Final</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									Following a semester of learning different economic and policy principles related to water resources, myself and peers investigated 
									the west coast drought in a policy recommendation <a href="WaterEcon&PolicyRec.pdf" download>document</a>.
